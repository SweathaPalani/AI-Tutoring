1. Develop a customer support chatbot that not only understands and responds to customer queries but also analyzes the sentiment of the inquiries to tailor responses and escalate issues if necessary.
Choose two language models from different providers (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3 and Hugging Face's BERT).
Write a program that integrates these models. You should simulate the initialization of these models with API keys. Create a function in your program that takes a user input prompt, sends the prompt to both models, and prints out their responses.

Example Interaction:
Customer: "I've been waiting for a week now, and my order still hasn’t arrived!"
BERT Sentiment Analysis: Negative
GPT-3 Response: "I'm really sorry to hear about this delay. I understand it’s frustrating. Let me check the status of your order right away."

2. Develop an interactive financial forecasting tool that not only responds to user queries about future market trends but also integrates economic indicators for a comprehensive analysis.

Example Interaction:
User: "What is the forecast for the real estate market in the next quarter?"
BERT Economic Summary: "Recent reports indicate a 3% increase in housing construction and a steady rise in mortgage rates."
GPT-3 Response: "Given the increase in housing construction and rising mortgage rates, the real estate market is expected to see moderate growth next quarter. Consider this an opportune time to explore real estate investments, but remain cautious of potential interest rate fluctuations."

3. Design a virtual teaching assistant that enhances learning experiences by assisting students in finding answers to questions while studying, reviewing, or researching topics, enhancing the learning experience.

Example Interaction:
Student: "Can you explain the theory of relativity?"
BERT Summary: "Einstein's theory of relativity includes special relativity and general relativity, dealing with the relationship between space and time, and the effect of gravity on the fabric of space-time, respectively."
GPT-3 Response: "Absolutely, the theory of relativity primarily focuses on how observers in different states of motion perceive phenomena like time, space, and gravity. For example, time appears to move slower near massive objects, according to general relativity, which has profound implications for understanding the universe."
